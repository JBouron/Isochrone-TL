# Isochrone-TL
Java project of the cs-108 EPFL class.

This was done for the cs108 EPFL class in collaboration with Nicolas Roussel (https://github.com/Rimbaud13).
Unfortunately the timetable data for the TL is licensed and we therefore can't upload it here. http://gtfs.geops.ch can be used to retrieve the data, we did not try it.

There are some screen captures to see it fully work.

OpensStreetMap is a liscensed thing, I don't know how to mention it.
In addition the project depends on © OpenStreetMap contributors and
